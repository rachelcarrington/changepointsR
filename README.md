# changepointsR

Changepoint algorithms and inference for change in mean model.

Changepoint algorithms:
binary_segmentation </br>
wild_binary_segmentation
narrowest_over_threshold

Post-selection inference:
Use calculate_pvals for binary segmentation, wild binary segmentation, and narrowest over threshold.
Use l0_segmentation_psi for L0 segmentation.

Dependencies:
ChangepointInference (https://github.com/jewellsean/ChangepointInference) for L0 segmentation

For plots:
ggplot2
Changepoint (for data)
