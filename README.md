# changepointsR

Changepoint algorithms and inference for change in mean model.

Changepoint algorithms: </br>
binary_segmentation </br>
wild_binary_segmentation </br>
narrowest_over_threshold

Post-selection inference: </br>
Use calculate_pvals for binary segmentation, wild binary segmentation, and narrowest over threshold. </br>
Use l0_segmentation_psi for L0 segmentation.

Dependencies: </br>
ChangepointInference (https://github.com/jewellsean/ChangepointInference) for L0 segmentation

For plots: </br>
ggplot2 </br>
Changepoint (for data)
